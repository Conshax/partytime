      <itunes:author>Jon Crabtree, Andy Schroder</itunes:author>
      <itunes:summary>Andy Schroder is an engineer and entrepreneur who has created the Bitcoin Fluid Dispenser and Distributed Charge.

These projects are Changing the Tide by providing a smooth path that vendors can use to dispense commodities and energy for Bitcoin in a trustless or near-trustless way. Both the seller and the buyer(s) can rely on their Bitcoin and Lightning full nodes to transact, bolstering their financial privacy and sovereignty.

Distributed Charge&apos;s proprietary Board A0 is &quot;The First Building Block of a Bitcoin Lightning Network Enabled Energy Grid.&quot; The goal is to create a truly distributed network of charging stations for electric cars.

      <itunes:author>Jon Crabtree, Alejandro de la Torre</itunes:author>
      <itunes:summary>Alejandro de la Torre has an extensive background in Bitcoin mining. He co-founded the mining pool BTC.com, which was later acquired by Bitmain, the maker of the Antminer. For the past 2+ years, he was VP at Poolin, a large Bitcoin mining pool.

Alejandro is Changing the Tide with Proofofwork.energy. He founded this new business just two weeks ago and is committed to decentralizing Bitcoin mining by making it happen in places where it has not yet proliferated. As the remaining supply of Bitcoin to be mined continues to decrease, this is going to help bring greater freedom and prosperity to those areas. It will also help better secure the network by combatting moves by governments that could significantly decrease hashrate, like the recent ban in the summer of 2021 by the People&apos;s Republic of China (PRC).

We talk about:
*the mission of Proofofwork.energy
*stories from his time in the PRC at BTC.com, Bitmain, and Poolin
*Alejandro&apos;s work coordinating communication with mining pools and Bitcoin Core developers in the lead up to Taproot activation, and how this stemmed from &quot;PTSD&quot; caused by the 2017 blocksize wars
*the benefits of Proof of Work (PoW) versus Proof of Stake (PoS)
*how the PRC came to dominate Bitcoin mining, and how he assisted the &quot;great miner migration&quot; after the mining ban there earlier this year

We talk about:
*what drew him into Bitcoin
*the ethos of Square Crypto, and Jack Dorsey&apos;s desire to build &quot;the native digital currency of the Internet&quot;
*the first three episodes of &quot;Hello Bitcoin,&quot; as well as what is coming in the next two

      <description>Fellow Class of 2017 Bitcoiner Conor Okus is part of the founding team that is building out Hello Bitcoin, a series dedicated to being &quot;Your friendly place to learn about Bitcoin.&quot; He is also host of Advancing Bitcoin, a podcast related to the 2-day Advancing Bitcoin event in London, featuring developers and designers who are making it easier to onboard new Bitcoiners. His day job is Product Manager at Square Crypto, where he and his team focus specifically on improving the developer experience in Bitcoin via the Lightning Development Kit.

Conor is Changing the Tide by helping guide the building out of ways for developers to choose Lightning features they want to integrate into their Bitcoin wallets. His team is also funding BTCPayServer, Bitcoin Core developers, designers working in the Bitcoin Design Community, and Lightning infrastructure projects. Outside of his 9-5, he is working tirelessly with others to build out educational material (like &quot;Hello Bitcoin&quot;) to onboard new people, as well as help decentralize the funding of Bitcoin&apos;s and Lightning&apos;s open-source development.

We talk about:
*what drew him into Bitcoin
*the ethos of Square Crypto, and Jack Dorsey&apos;s desire to build &quot;the native digital currency of the Internet&quot;
*the first three episodes of &quot;Hello Bitcoin,&quot; as well as what is coming in the next two
*what he&apos;s most excited about over the next couple of years
*how to onboard others to Bitcoin in a way that helps them &quot;get it&quot;

      <itunes:summary>Natalie Brunell (Twitter: @natbrunell) is a former news reporter and anchor, and now the host of Coin Stories Podcast (www.youtube.com/channel/UCru3nlhzHrbgK21x0MdB_eg).

*how she landed interviews with Michael Saylor and Saifedean Ammous as a result of Bitcoin 2021
*her course with Pomp, Bitcoin for Women, and how that came about
*some of the most interesting stories she&apos;s learned from her interviews
*and more

*his family&apos;s migration to California, moving back to Ethiopia after college, and landing in Austin
*what laid the groundwork for him to become a Bitcoiner
*inflation as Ethiopia&apos;s biggest burden, and what Ethiopians are doing to beat it
*Bitcoin as the answer to the inflation problem in Ethiopia
*what people like Neel Kashkari of the Minneapolis Fed misunderstand about how Bitcoin can create new opportunities in places like Ethiopia
*meeting Lightning developers at PlebFi and BitDevs in Austin, including a cool realization about how much sense it makes for @roasbeef to be working on the network
*my Bitcoin journey, which Kal was kind enough to ask about

Jack and his company are Changing the Tide when it comes to onboarding people to Bitcoin. Like a Bitcoin faucet, you can win Bitcoin for &quot;free&quot; through his games.

We also talked about:
*the two current THNDR Games in the app stores, and the differences between Apple and Google Play in terms of what you can win
*his early start in mobile games + how he got into Bitcoin/Lightning Network
*his focus on branding and why it is important
*being an entrepreneur in the Bitcoin industry, and working with others on Lightning (like the ZEBEDEE crew)
*the growth he&apos;s seen in the number of players downloading his games, and where growth has been hottest
*THNDR&apos;s upcoming merch drop in the Lightning Store
*what&apos;s coming next for THNDR Games

      <title>0.00000002: Mike Peterson, Bitcoin Beach</title>
      <itunes:subtitle></itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:author>Jon Crabtree, Mike Peterson</itunes:author>
      <itunes:summary>Mike Peterson runs the Twitter handle @Bitcoinbeach and helped start that initiative in El Zonte, El Salvador. Many point to this community-led movement as instrumental in offering a playbook that made possible the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador on June 8, 2021. That law goes into effect today (September 7, 2021).

As Bitcoin Beach has been Changing the Tide in terms of Lightning Network adoption in El Salvador, it is coinciding with some rather interesting positive side effects. People who generally could not think in terms of savings have begun to do so. The virtuous cycle of growth on Lightning Network leading to growth in cellular service, leading back to growth on Lightning. And more.

We also talked about:
*Why he&apos;s hoping for a slow rollout of the Bitcoin Law
*Most of Mike&apos;s life being preparation for understanding Bitcoin
*Bitcoin Beach&apos;s origin as a community-led initiative
*What most in financially privileged positions miss about the importance of Bitcoin and Lightning Network in areas locked out of the G7 financial system
*How Galoy is miles ahead because of their help developing Bitcoin Beach&apos;s Wallet
*Why lack of Internet access is a misguided critique of the new Bitcoin Law due to high levels of smartphone penetration and improvements in smartphone tech
*The power of Lightning Network, how it&apos;s bringing benefits to people in places like El Salvador, and how this wave may make it back to the shores of traditional centers of power
